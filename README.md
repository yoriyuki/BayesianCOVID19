Bayesian modeling of COVID-19 epidemiology 

We estimate the daily change of the reproducing rate R and reporting rate in Japan by a Bayesian method.
The estimate reveals a recent downward trend.
Although our analysis is preliminary, this may suggest that Japanese policy had some impact on the spread of infection.
